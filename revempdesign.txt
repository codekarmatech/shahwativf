# Objective
Redesign the Shashwat IVF & Women’s Hospital site to replicate—and improve upon—the structure, feel, and interactivity of https://www.safefertilitygroup.com/en/home, using React (JSX) + Tailwind CSS, with content from Django REST API.

## 1. Navigation
- Top fixed navbar (glassmorphism) with EN/HI toggles.
- Multi-level mega-menus:
  - “About Us” (with subitems).
  - “Our Services” (all IVF, IUI, Egg Freezing, Embryo Transfer, etc.).
  - “Investor Relations” (omit if not needed).
- Slide-down animation: 0.3s, staggered 0.1s per item.
- “Book Consultation” button (Light Gold #E8D5A1).

## 2. Hero & Appointment Form
- Hero height: 100vh; BG: gradient Soft Blue→Warm Pink; heading (Lora, 48px desktop / 36px mobile) fade-in up (0.6s).
- Bottom-sticky appointment form component:
  - Fields: Service (dropdown), Branch (dropdown).
  - Button: “Make Appointment” (rounded 8px, hover scale 1.05 + shadow).
  - Animate upward on scroll into view.

## 3. Parallax & Glassmorphism
- Insert two SVG sphere layers per section:
  - Sharp sphere moving at scroll speed 0.5×.
  - Blurred sphere at 0.2×.
- Glass cards: `backdrop-filter: blur(10px); background: rgba(255,255,255,0.1)`.

## 4. “Why Choose Us”
- Full-width BG image with overlay cards (icon + headline + text).
- Grid: 3 columns desktop, 1 column mobile.
- Cards fade-in with 0.2s stagger.

## 5. Services Section
- Bento Grid v2.0:
  - “For Women”: 2×2 main card + two 1×1 cards.
  - “For Men” & “Others”: similar.
- Card hover: scale 1.05, shadow deepen.
- “Explore” link bottom-right.

## 6. Success-Rate Counters
- Animated counters (0 → target) triggered via Intersection Observer.
- Style: large bold text (Poppins Bold 64px), label below.
- BG panels semi-transparent over section BG.

## 7. News & Blog
- 3-column grid desktop; carousel mobile.
- Each item: date (Inter 14px), headline (Lora Bold 20px), “Read More.”
- Fade-up on scroll with 0.1s item delay.

## 8. Branch Locator

- CTA “Find Nearest Branch” linking to contact page.

## 9. Footer
- 4-column layout: Quick Links, Contact Info, Newsletter, Social.
- Accreditation badges row.

## 10. Accessibility & Performance
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant: ARIA roles, keyboard nav, alt tags.
- Mobile-first breakpoints: 1col <640px, 2col 640–1024px, 3col >1024px.
- Image optimization: lazy loading, responsive `srcset`.
- Code-splitting & tree-shaking for performance.

## 11. Components & Animations
- Use Framer Motion for all enter/exit animations.
- Reusable components:
  - `<Navbar />`, `<MegaMenu />`, `<HeroWithForm />`
  - `<ParallaxLayer />`, `<GlassCard />`
  - `<BentoGrid services=[...] />`, `<Counter />`
  - `<NewsGrid />`, `<BranchCards />`, `<Footer />`
- Document PropTypes, CSS variable usage in `tailwind.config.js`.

# Deliverables
- Complete, production-ready code for all above components.
- Example `.env.example` for API endpoints.
- README with setup, deploy, and customization instructions.
