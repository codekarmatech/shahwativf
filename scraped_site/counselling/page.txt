Counsellings
Our counselling service includes support for all IVF patients as well as specialist counselling for our donor programmes and genetic testing. All patients of Shaswat IVF  are offered private  counselling sessions prior to commencing hormone stimulation and just before embryo transfer. We find this places couples in the best possible emotional state for their treatment. Research shows that emotional and mental stability can have a positive impact on the procedure.
We works closely with individuals and couples to help them cope with
Successfully managing the fertility roller coaster
Replacing fears and anxiety with relaxation along their fertility journey
Staying mentally and emotionally calm while undergoing fertility treatment
Early pregnancy challenges and preparing for birth
Coping with grief and loss after miscarriage or stillbirth
