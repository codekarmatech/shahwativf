# Shashwat IVF and Women's Hospital Website Design Specification

This document outlines the design specifications for recreating the Shashwat IVF and Women's Hospital website (https://www.shashwativf.com/) with a modern, calming, and premium aesthetic suitable for a women's hospital and IVF center. The design incorporates a Bento Grid v2.0 layout, smooth animations for title texts, and a responsive navbar with dropdown menus for all services. The website will use React for the frontend and Django for the backend, with all content manageable through the Django admin panel.

## 1. Design Goals
The website aims to achieve the following:
- **Calming Aesthetic**: Create a soothing experience with soft colors, rounded edges, and gentle animations to reflect the sensitive nature of fertility and women's health.
- **Ultra-Modern Tech**: Incorporate cutting-edge design trends like Bento Grid v2.0, glassmorphism, and subtle gradients for a futuristic yet accessible look.
- **Professional and Premium**: Deliver a polished, high-end feel with clean typography, consistent spacing, and premium UI elements.
- **Easy to Understand**: Simplify navigation and content presentation for users of all technical levels, with clear calls-to-action (CTAs).
- **Rich and Engaging**: Use animations, interactive elements, and a modular layout to make the website visually appealing and engaging.

## 2. Theme and Color Palette
The theme is designed to evoke trust, care, and femininity, aligning with the hospital's focus on women's health and fertility.

### Color Palette
| **Color**         | **Hex Code** | **Purpose**                              |
|-------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| Primary (Soft Blue) | #4B9CD3      | Conveys trust and calmness, ideal for healthcare. |
| Secondary (Warm Pink) | #F7C6C7      | Adds a nurturing, feminine touch, used subtly. |
| Accent (Light Gold) | #E8D5A1      | Highlights CTAs and adds a premium feel.  |
| Neutral (White)   | #FFFFFF      | Clean backgrounds for content.           |
| Neutral (Light Gray) | #F5F5F5      | Subtle backgrounds for sections.         |
| Neutral (Dark Gray) | #333333      | Text and contrast for readability.       |

- **Gradient**: Linear gradient from Soft Blue to Warm Pink for hero sections, buttons, and select backgrounds to add a modern, dynamic touch.
- **Usage**: Primary colors dominate headers and navigation, secondary colors accentuate service cards, and the accent color highlights CTAs like "Book Consultation."

### Typography
- **Primary Font**: Inter (sans-serif, clean, modern, highly legible).
  - Weights: Regular (400), Medium (500), Bold (700).
- **Secondary Font**: Lora (serif, warm, elegant for headings).
  - Weights: Regular (400), Bold (700).
- **Font Sizes**:
  - Headings (h1): 48px (desktop), 36px (mobile).
  - Subheadings (h2): 32px (desktop), 24px (mobile).
  - Body Text: 16px (desktop), 14px (mobile).
  - Captions: 12px (desktop), 10px (mobile).
- **Line Height**: 1.5 for body text, 1.2 for headings.
- **Letter Spacing**: 0.5px for headings, standard for body text.
- **Usage**: Inter for body text and navigation ensures readability, while Lora for headings adds warmth and sophistication.

### UI Elements
- **Buttons**: Rounded (8px radius), with hover effects (scale up by 1.05, shadow enhancement). Use Light Gold for primary CTAs and Soft Blue for secondary buttons.
- **Cards**: Glassmorphism effect (semi-transparent backgrounds with blur, e.g., `background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1); backdrop-filter: blur(10px);`) for service and doctor cards to create a premium, modern look.
- **Icons**: Use Line Awesome or Font Awesome for clean, scalable icons (e.g., social media, navigation arrows).
- **Forms**: Clean, minimal input fields with subtle borders and placeholders, ensuring accessibility with clear labels.

## 3. UI/UX Principles
The design adheres to modern healthcare web design trends (inspired by sources like Motionbuzz and Webstacks, 2025):
- **Calming**: Soft colors, rounded corners, and smooth animations reduce visual stress.
- **Ultra-Modern Tech**: Bento Grid v2.0, glassmorphism, and AI-driven personalization (e.g., adaptive navigation) for a cutting-edge experience.
- **Professional**: Consistent 8px grid system, high-quality visuals, and clear branding.
- **Easy to Understand**: Intuitive navigation with descriptive labels, minimal clicks to access information, and clear CTAs.
- **Premium**: Subtle gradients, shadows, and high-resolution images (when provided) for a luxurious feel.
- **Accessible**: Comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards, including screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, and sufficient color contrast.
- **Mobile-First**: Optimize for mobile devices, as 61.5% of web traffic comes from mobile users (Webstacks, 2025).
- **Trust and Credibility**: Clean layouts, consistent tone, and high-quality content to convey expertise and reliability.

## 4. Bento Grid v2.0 Implementation
Bento Grid v2.0 is a modular, rectangular layout inspired by Japanese bento boxes, organizing content into visually distinct sections of varying sizes. It’s ideal for showcasing services, doctors, and success stories in a dynamic, organized manner.

### Bento Grid Usage
| **Page/Section**       | **Bento Grid Layout**                                                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Homepage (Services)    | 4-6 cards (e.g., Ob & Gynecology, Fertility), varying sizes (2x2 for main, 1x1 for secondary). |
| Homepage (Why Choose Us) | 6 cards (Expertise, Facilities, etc.), each with an icon and brief text.            |
| Service Pages          | 2-column grid: large section for main content, smaller sections for related services. |
| Success Stories        | Alternating large and small cards for testimonials, with images (if provided).       |
| Media Coverage         | Cards for media links or embedded videos, varying sizes for visual interest.         |

- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts to 1-column on mobile, 2-3 columns on tablet, 3-4 columns on desktop.
- **Hover Effects**: Cards scale up (1.05x) and increase shadow opacity on hover.
- **Glassmorphism**: Apply frosted glass effect to cards for a premium look.
- **Spacing**: 16px gaps between grid items for a clean, airy layout.

## 5. Animations
Animations enhance the premium feel while maintaining a calming effect, applied to all title texts and interactive elements.

### Title Animations
- **Effect**: Fade-in with a slight upward slide (0.6s duration for homepage, 0.4s for subpages).
- **Trigger**: On page load or when titles enter the viewport.
- **Variants**:
  - Homepage titles: Fade-in with a gentle upward motion.
  - Subpage titles: Slide-in from the left for a dynamic effect.
  - Dropdown menu items: Fade-in with a staggered delay (0.1s per item).

### Other Animations
- **Buttons**: Scale up (1.05x) and brighten on hover (0.3s transition).
- **Cards**: Fade-in with a slight scale-up when entering the viewport.
- **Navbar Dropdown**: Smooth slide-down (0.3s) with staggered item animations.
- **Footer Links**: Underline effect on hover for social media links.

## 6. Folder Structure
The project is split between Django (backend) and React (frontend), with a structured organization for content and media.
